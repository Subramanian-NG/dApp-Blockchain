# dApp-Blockchain

Simple smart contract application with front end(React and JS) and Backend(Solidity).

This contract can be used in shipment process(FedX, DHL) to make the process more transparent,trustless and reliable. The information pertaining to each phase of the shipment process (transportation, warehousing, customs clearance, and delivery) is recorded and stored on a blockchain network. The entities(Shipment provider, Sender, Receiver) can check the shipment information any time from the dApp, which will fetch the data from blockchain network.
